    1. What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)
    
        Population size: 100000	Initial number infected: 10 Virus: Ebola Mortality rate: 0.7 Reproduction rate: 0.25

    2. What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?

        9.577% of the population became infected during the simulation.

    3. What percentage of the population died from the virus?

        6.665% of the population died in the simulation.

    4. Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many times, in total, did a vaccination save someone from potentially becoming infected?

        Total number of interactions: 957700
        Number of times a person was protected by a vaccine: 905706
